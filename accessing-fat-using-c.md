# Accessing FAT using C {#accessing-fat-using-c}

In the previous sections you have learnt how to build up a virtual disk and format it as FAT. Now this section will introduce how we can access the file system using C.

You can find the sample codes used here:

1. [viewDisk.c](assets/codes/viewDisk.c)

   * for getting the parameters of the devices

2. [viewRoot.c](assets/codes/viewRoot.c)

   * for viewing the entries in the root directory.
