user and a single group, and has its own access permissions. The most common way to view the permissions of a file is ls -l myfile.\nThe meaning of each column is shown as follows.\nThe first column is file mode. \n\nFiles mode contains information of file type and permissions. \nThe owner of a file belongs to user category. \nThe members of the file's group belong to group category while other users that are not part of the user or group categories belong to other category. \n\n\nEvery category has three permissions: read, write, execute indicated byr,w,xrespectively. A hyphen (-) in the place of one of these characters indicates that the respective permission is not available for the respective category. We can see that execute permission of file \"myfile\" do not available for all three categories.\nPermissions can also be represented with octal notation. \n\nEach permission category (owner, group, other) is represented by a number between 0 and 7. \nWe let read permission equals to 4, while write and execute permissions equal to 2 and 1 respectively. \nAdd up the numbers associated with the type of permissions we would like to grant for each category. This will be a number between 0 and 7 (0 representing no permissions and 7 representing full read, write, and execute permissions) for each category. \n\nFor example, \"777\" means that all these permission categories have read, write and execute permissions.\nModifying Permissions -- chmod \nTo change a file's permissions, we can use the chmod command with octal notation. \nFor example, we want to execute \"myfile\" as the owner and we don't want anyone else to modify the file, including group owners. Then we can command\nchmod 744 myfile\n\nAs you can see, the permissions were assigned correctly.\nSetting Default Permissions -- umask \numaskdefines the default permissions for newly created files based on the \"base\" permissions set defined for files and directories. Usually the base permissions set is 777, that is files or directories can be read, write, and execute permissions for all users. Base permissions subtract \"mask\", then we get the default permissions for newly created files.\nFor example, we use touch to creat a new file \"test\", where the default permissions of \"test\" are 664. If we want to change the default permissions to be 666, then we can use umask to set \"mask\" to be 777-666=111, as shown in the below picture.\n\n"},"dd.html":{"url":"dd.html","title":"Disk Duplication","keywords":"","body":"Disk Duplicationdd \nddis a command for low-level copying.
